This is a locally hosted website that I use to practice web design.  Feel free to download the folder and test it out yourself.
Opening the index.html file should open a web page in your browser, from there you can navigate the site and test out the functionality. 
Please note that all files are hosted locally to your computer.  This can also be used as a base template to begin designing a website from pure HTML.
